# Instructions Before go to the solutioning
Do not solve the problem until you understand correctly.
Do not go with your assumptions. Do not hesitate to ask your interviewer questions about the problem,
to make sure what you understand, reiterate the question to the interviewer what your understandings are.

Start with an example to solidify your understandings:Once you understand the question, you should always try an example, these examples may lead to insights on how to solve the problem or this brings to light any remaining misunderstandings that you have.

These examples are useful when you don't see the solution right away.

On start solving the problem, keep talking! Always explain what you are doing on each step

This process may take long time to solve the problem, you may be tempted to begin the coding before you figure out how to solve the problem, resist this temptation.

**Note:** Its a good practice to think before coding and write the error free code, rather than several mistakes by writing hurry code and doesn't have any idea where he is going. i.e you have to write an algorithm or pseudo code before start writing actual code.

Write your best code, it is the platform for showing your abilities and way of writing the code. Respond well to the hints given by the interviewer.

- Take one input and walk through the code you wrote, this helps you identify the bugs in your code. you can do this step before asked by the interviewer also.
- Try writing the neat code with the tabs and formatting correctly.
- Try avoiding syntax errors
- Finally, make sure you code handles all edge cases (like 0, null, undefined, empty list) 

Many of the problems asked by the interviewer, requires using tricks or uncommonly used features of language

**When you get Stuck:** 
Interviewers want to see how you respond when you don't recognize the answer to a question immediately. The worst thing is give up or get frustrated, Instead show interest in the problem and keep trying to solve it.When all else fails go back to the example and try performing the task and try analyzing what you doing. Then try extending from your specific example to general case. you may have to use very detailed examples. this is Ok. Another fallback option is to try using a different data structure to implement, look for a more similar data structure, and use it. using the right data structure often makes the problem much easier.
You should also consider less commonly used or most advanced aspects of a language, this includes bit operators, complex point casting, union types

**What to learn:**
The correct solutions are short rarely 15 and never more than 30 lines of code.If you start writing lots of code means its a warning, that you are heading to the wrong direction.
Know how arithmetic and logical operator works
try using one over other example equality check without using =. you can use the logical operator like ^

How hash table different from binary search tree

To check myName variable is not ( null or false or 0 or undefined )you can simply write 
      
      if(myName) // this is a better way to use and the new way of checking

instead of checking like if(myName != null)
and mention that but both are the same.

### Big-O Notation:
1) Figure out what the input is and what n represents
2) Express the number of operations the algorithm performs in terms of n
3) Eliminate all but the highest order terms.4) Remove all constant factors

### What is Datastructure?
Different ways of storing data in computer. A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively

## Types of Datastructures
- Array
- Linked List
- Stack (LIFO)
- Queue (FIFO)
- HashTable
- HashMap
- Heap
- Tree
- Graph

## Array vs ArrayList vs List vs LinkedList in C#

- Array: Fixed in size, it is strongly typed. retrive will be O(1) and add/remove needs to shift all the elements
```javascript
int[] evenNums = new int[5];
evenNums[0] = 2;
evenNums[1] = 4;
//evenNums[6] = 12;  //Throws run-time exception IndexOutOfRange

Console.WriteLine(evenNums[0]);  //prints 2
Console.WriteLine(evenNums[1]);  //prints 4
// short syntax
int[] evenNums = { 2, 4, 6, 8, 10}; 
var cities = new string[]{ "Mumbai", "London", "New York" }; 
string[] cities = new string[3]{ "Mumbai", "London", "New York" };
```
- ArrayList: Grow in size by currentSize*1.5(ex: 10 becomes 10 * 1.5=15), it's dynamic so every element treated as an object. retrive will be O(1) and add/remove needs to shift all the elements.
any type elements can be added. on retrival typeCasting (boxing and unboxing) is required
```javascript
// Creates and initializes a new ArrayList.
ArrayList myAL = new ArrayList();
myAL.Add("Hello");
myAL.Add(2.5);
myAL.Add(123);
Console.WriteLine((string)myAL[0]); // 'Hello'

var arlist = new ArrayList(){ 1, "Bill", 300, 4.5f };
//Access individual item using indexer
int firstElement = (int) arlist[0]; //returns 1
string secondElement = (string) arlist[1]; //returns "Bill"
```
- List: is implemented on top of the ArrayList. it is strongly typed objects so, on retrival typecasting is not required.  retrive will be O(1) and add/remove needs to shift all the elements.
```javascript
List<int> numbers = new List<int>() { 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 10 };
Console.WriteLine(numbers[0]); // prints 1
Console.WriteLine(numbers[1]); // prints 2
```
- LinkedList: LinkedList will be formed with the list of nodes. Each node have Data and address of previous node then it is called single Linked list and If it also has adrress of next node then it is a doubly linked list.
- it is strongly typed Add/Remove will be easy with O(1). but retrival takes long time as it has to go through all the elements
```javascript
LinkedList<string> sentence = new LinkedList<string>(words);
sentence.AddFirst("today");
```

## Stack(LIFO) and Queue(FIFO) can be easily implemented using the Arrays
Arrays have below operations:
- push => add new element to end of an array
- pop => delete element from an end of an array
- shift => delete element from start of an array. which is first element in an array

#### => Stack is Last In First Out (LIFO) => last element is the first to pop out. we can use push and pop operations
- push => add new element to end of stack 
- pop => remove element from end of stack and return it
- top => return top element of a stack  after pop out the element 

Best example is: stacking the plates one on other. ex2: reverse string, ex3: Balanced paranthesis

#### => Queue is First in First Out (FIFO) => first element is the first to pop out. we can use push and shift operations
- enqueue => Add new element to the end of queue
- dequeue => remove element from starting of the queue
- getFrontElement => after removal get the first element in queue

Best example is: queue line infront of shopping mall, ex2: find binary value of a given number

## Hashtable
[more info](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-a-hash-table)
A hash table is a type of data structure that stores key-value pairs. The key is sent to a hash function that performs arithmetic operations on it. **The hash table will be an array of linked lists.** All keys mapping to the same index will be stored as linked list nodes at that index.

Hashtable data structure having the key and value pair with hash function. This is similar to the Object. We can implement the Hashtable using Object in Javascript but there are some caveats with this approach like we can overwrite the default properties defined for the object hence it is not the right way of implementation

For this Reason, javacript have another [implementation](./hashtable.js) of hashTable with Map. 

A Hash Table transforms a key into an integer index using a hash function, and the index will decide where to store the key/value pair in memory:
[more info JS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-hash-table-associative-array-hashing-in-js/) | [more info C#](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/csharp/csharp-hashtable)

- Hashtable is not generic hence while accessing the elements we need to do type casting
- If the key is not found in HashTable it will return undefined(in javascript) and null (in C#)

#### In Short: Its a technique to convert a range of key values into a range of indexes of an array. 

Hashfunction help us to generate the uniq index (by using ASCII values) then we convert key and value as an array and pass this as value and uniqIndex as a Key.
```javascript
const hashTable =  {
      uniqIndex:[key, vlaue],
      uniqIndex1:[key, vlaue],
      uniqIndex2:[key, vlaue]
  }
// uniqIndex will generated by using the hash function
 const _hash = (key:any) =>  {
    let hash = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < key.length; i++) {
      hash += key.charCodeAt(i); // getting the ASCII number
    }
    
     // return hash; // we can also written the hash here but due to the JS limitation reason below
     // But since the HashTable class only has 127 buckets, this means that the _hash() method must return a number between 0 and 127.
     // To ensure that the hash value doesn't exceed the bucket size, you need to use the modulo operator as shown below:
    return hash % this.table.length;
  }
```

--------------------------------------------
## Data Structures
### Linked List
 * A *Linked List* is a linear collection of data elements, called nodes, each
   pointing to the next node by means of a pointer. It is a data structure
   consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence.
 * **Singly-linked list**: linked list in which each node points to the next node and the last node points to null
 * **Doubly-linked list**: linked list in which each node has two pointers, p and n, such that p points to the previous node and n points to the next node; the last node's n pointer points to null
 * **Circular-linked list**: linked list in which each node points to the next node and the last node points back to the first node
 * Time Complexity:
   * Access: `O(n)`
   * Search: `O(n)`
   * Insert: `O(1)`
   * Remove: `O(1)`

### Stack
 * A *Stack* is a collection of elements, with two principle operations: *push*, which adds to the collection, and
   *pop*, which removes the most recently added element
 * **Last in, first out data structure (LIFO)**: the most recently added object is the first to be removed
 * Time Complexity:
   * Access: `O(n)`
   * Search: `O(n)`
   * Insert: `O(1)`
   * Remove: `O(1)`

### Queue
 * A *Queue* is a collection of elements, supporting two principle operations: *enqueue*, which inserts an element
   into the queue, and *dequeue*, which removes an element from the queue
 * **First in, first out data structure (FIFO)**: the oldest added object is the first to be removed
 * Time Complexity:
   * Access: `O(n)`
   * Search: `O(n)`
   * Insert: `O(1)`
   * Remove: `O(1)`

### Tree
 * A *Tree* is an undirected, connected, acyclic graph

### Binary Tree
 * A *Binary Tree* is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as
   the *left child* and *right child*
 * **Full Tree**: a tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children
 * **Perfect Binary Tree**: a binary tree in which all interior nodes have two children and all leave have the same depth
 * **Complete Tree**: a binary tree in which every level *except possibly the last* is full and all nodes in the last
   level are as far left as possible

### Binary Search Tree
 * A binary search tree, sometimes called BST, is a type of binary tree which maintains the property that the value in each
   node must be greater than or equal to any value stored in the left sub-tree, and less than or equal to any value stored
   in the right sub-tree
 * Time Complexity:
   * Access: `O(log(n))`
   * Search: `O(log(n))`
   * Insert: `O(log(n))`
   * Remove: `O(log(n))`

<img src="/images/BST.png?raw=true" alt="Binary Search Tree" width="400" height="500">

### Trie
* A trie, sometimes called a radix or prefix tree, is a kind of search tree that is used to store a dynamic set or associative
  array where the keys are usually Strings. No node in the tree stores the key associated with that node; instead, its position 
  in the tree defines the key with which it is associated. All the descendants of a node have a common prefix of the String associated 
  with that node, and the root is associated with the empty String.

![Alt text](/images/trie.png?raw=true "Trie")

### Fenwick Tree
* A Fenwick tree, sometimes called a binary indexed tree, is a tree in concept, but in practice is implemented as an implicit data
  structure using an array. Given an index in the array representing a vertex, the index of a vertex's parent or child is calculated
  through bitwise operations on the binary representation of its index. Each element of the array contains the pre-calculated sum of
  a range of values, and by combining that sum with additional ranges encountered during an upward traversal to the root, the prefix
  sum is calculated
* Time Complexity:
  * Range Sum: `O(log(n))`
  * Update: `O(log(n))`

![Alt text](/images/fenwickTree.png?raw=true "Fenwick Tree")

### Segment Tree
* A Segment tree, is a tree data structure for storing intervals, or segments. It allows querying which of the stored segments contain
  a given point
* Time Complexity:
  * Range Query: `O(log(n))`
  * Update: `O(log(n))`

![Alt text](/images/segmentTree.png?raw=true "Segment Tree")

### Heap
* A *Heap* is a specialized tree based structure data structure that satisfies the *heap* property: if A is a parent node of
B, then the key (the value) of node A is ordered with respect to the key of node B with the same ordering applying across the entire heap.
A heap can be classified further as either a "max heap" or a "min heap". In a max heap, the keys of parent nodes are always greater
than or equal to those of the children and the highest key is in the root node. In a min heap, the keys of parent nodes are less than
or equal to those of the children and the lowest key is in the root node
* Time Complexity:
  * Access Max / Min: `O(1)`
  * Insert: `O(log(n))`
  * Remove Max / Min: `O(log(n))`

<img src="/images/heap.png?raw=true" alt="Max Heap" width="400" height="500">


### Hashing
* *Hashing* is used to map data of an arbitrary size to data of a fixed size. The values returned by a hash
  function are called hash values, hash codes, or simply hashes. If two keys map to the same value, a collision occurs
* **Hash Map**: a *hash map* is a structure that can map keys to values. A hash map uses a hash function to compute
  an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.
* Collision Resolution
 * **Separate Chaining**: in *separate chaining*, each bucket is independent, and contains a list of entries for each index. The
 time for hash map operations is the time to find the bucket (constant time), plus the time to iterate through the list
 * **Open Addressing**: in *open addressing*, when a new entry is inserted, the buckets are examined, starting with the
 hashed-to-slot and proceeding in some sequence, until an unoccupied slot is found. The name open addressing refers to
 the fact that the location of an item is not always determined by its hash value


![Alt text](/images/hash.png?raw=true "Hashing")

### Graph
* A *Graph* is an ordered pair of G = (V, E) comprising a set V of vertices or nodes together with a set E of edges or arcs,
  which are 2-element subsets of V (i.e. an edge is associated with two vertices, and that association takes the form of the
  unordered pair comprising those two vertices)
 * **Undirected Graph**: a graph in which the adjacency relation is symmetric. So if there exists an edge from node u to node
 v (u -> v), then it is also the case that there exists an edge from node v to node u (v -> u)
 * **Directed Graph**: a graph in which the adjacency relation is not symmetric. So if there exists an edge from node u to node v
 (u -> v), this does *not* imply that there exists an edge from node v to node u (v -> u)

  * Worst Case: `O(nlog(n))`
  * Average Case: `O(nlog(n))`

![Alt text](/images/mergesort.gif?raw=true "Mergesort")

![Alt text](/images/bucketsort.png?raw=true "Bucket Sort")

#### Radix Sort
* *Radix Sort* is a sorting algorithm that like bucket sort, distributes elements of an array into a number of buckets. However, radix
  sort differs from bucket sort by 're-bucketing' the array after the initial pass as opposed to sorting each bucket and merging
* Time Complexity:
  * Best Case: `Ω(nk)`
  * Worst Case: `O(nk)`
  * Average Case: `Θ(nk)`

### Graph Algorithms

#### Depth First Search
* *Depth First Search* is a graph traversal algorithm which explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking

![Alt text](/images/dfsbfs.gif?raw=true "DFS / BFS Traversal")

#### Breadth First Search
* *Breadth First Search* is a graph traversal algorithm which explores the neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next
  level neighbors
* Time Complexity: `O(|V| + |E|)`

![Alt text](/images/dfsbfs.gif?raw=true "DFS / BFS Traversal")

#### Topological Sort
* *Topological Sort* is the linear ordering of a directed graph's nodes such that for every edge from node u to node v, u

![Alt text](/images/dijkstra.gif?raw=true "Dijkstra's")

#### Bellman-Ford Algorithm
* *Bellman-Ford Algorithm* is an algorithm that computes the shortest paths from a single source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph
* Although it is slower than Dijkstra's, it is more versatile, as it is capable of handling graphs in which some of the edge weights are
  negative numbers
* Time Complexity:
  * Best Case: `O(|E|)`
  * Worst Case: `O(|V||E|)`

![Alt text](/images/bellman-ford.gif?raw=true "Bellman-Ford")

#### Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
* *Floyd-Warshall Algorithm* is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights, but
  no negative cycles
* A single execution of the algorithm will find the lengths (summed weights) of the shortest paths between *all* pairs of nodes
* Time Complexity:
  * Best Case: `O(|V|^3)`
  * Worst Case: `O(|V|^3)`
  * Average Case: `O(|V|^3)`

#### Prim's Algorithm
* *Prim's Algorithm* is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph. In other words, Prim's find a
  subset of edges that forms a tree that includes every node in the graph
* Time Complexity: `O(|V|^2)`

![Alt text](/images/prim.gif?raw=true "Prim's Algorithm")

#### Kruskal's Algorithm
* *Kruskal's Algorithm* is also a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree in a graph. However, in Kruskal's, the graph does not
  have to be connected
* Time Complexity: `O(|E|log|V|)`

![Alt text](/images/kruskal.gif?raw=true "Kruskal's Algorithm")

## Greedy Algorithms
* *Greedy Algorithms* are algorithms that make locally optimal choices at each step in the hope of eventually reaching the globally optimal solution
* Problems must exhibit two properties in order to implement a Greedy solution:
 * Optimal Substructure
    * An optimal solution to the problem contains optimal solutions to the given problem's subproblems
 * The Greedy Property
    * An optimal solution is reached by "greedily" choosing the locally optimal choice without ever reconsidering previous choices
* Example - Coin Change
    * Given a target amount V cents and a list of denominations of n coins, i.e. we have coinValue[i] (in cents) for coin types i from [0...n - 1],
      what is the minimum number of coins that we must use to represent amount V? Assume that we have an unlimited supply of coins of any type
    * Coins - Penny (1 cent), Nickel (5 cents), Dime (10 cents), Quarter (25 cents)
    * Assume V = 41. We can use the Greedy algorithm of continuously selecting the largest coin denomination less than or equal to V, subtract that
      coin's value from V, and repeat.
    * V = 41 | 0 coins used
    * V = 16 | 1 coin used (41 - 25 = 16)
    * V = 6  | 2 coins used (16 - 10 = 6)
    * V = 1  | 3 coins used (6 - 5 = 1)
    * V = 0  | 4 coins used (1 - 1 = 0)
    * Using this algorithm, we arrive at a total of 4 coins which is optimal

## Bitmasks
* Bitmasking is a technique used to perform operations at the bit level. Leveraging bitmasks often leads to faster runtime complexity and
  helps limit memory usage
* Test kth bit: `s & (1 << k);`
* Set kth bit: `s |= (1 << k);`
* Turn off kth bit: `s &= ~(1 << k);`
* Toggle kth bit: `s ^= (1 << k);`
* Multiple by 2<sup>n</sup>: `s << n;`
* Divide by 2<sup>n</sup>: `s >> n;`
* Intersection: `s & t;`
* Union: `s | t;`
* Set Subtraction: `s & ~t;`
* Extract lowest set bit: `s & (-s);`
* Extract lowest unset bit: `~s & (s + 1);`
* Swap Values:
             ```
                x ^= y;
                y ^= x;
                x ^= y;
             ```

## Runtime Analysis

#### Big O Notation
* *Big O Notation* is used to describe the upper bound of a particular algorithm. Big O is used to describe worst case scenarios

![Alt text](/images/bigO.png?raw=true "Theta Notation")

#### Little O Notation
* *Little O Notation* is also used to describe an upper bound of a particular algorithm; however, Little O provides a bound
  that is not asymptotically tight

#### Big Ω Omega Notation
* *Big Omega Notation* is used to provide an asymptotic lower bound on a particular algorithm

![Alt text](/images/bigOmega.png?raw=true "Theta Notation")

#### Little ω Omega Notation
* *Little Omega Notation* is used to provide a lower bound on a particular algorithm that is not asymptotically tight

#### Theta Θ Notation
* *Theta Notation* is used to provide a bound on a particular algorithm such that it can be "sandwiched" between
  two constants (one for an upper limit and one for a lower limit) for sufficiently large values
