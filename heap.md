# Heap 
[for Better video explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqPJF2L5h9U)

Heap is a data structure of type Trees.

Array representation of Bindary tree will be done by using below Formulas, so that we can easily find any element in the heap  and If the leaf is empty Array should leave that as empty space

Ex: 

| Operation                    | Formula           | Example           |
| -----------------------------|:-----------------:| -----------------:|
| If a Node is at Index        | i                 | 5                 |
| If a left child is at Index  | 2 * i             | 2 * 5 = 10        |
| If a right child is at Index | 2 * i + 1         | 2 * 5 +1 = 10+1   |
| If a parent is at Index      | (mod of i/2)      |  mod of 2.5 = 2   |
